# Syvertsen.dev

This is my personal portfolio webpage which is made using Gatsby from the template made by [Jacobo Mart√≠nez](https://github.com/cobidev), and hosted by netlify.

## Deployment

If you want to set up a working environment in order to test features of the page or something else, you'll do that as follows:

Clone the repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/andesyv/syvertsen.dev
```

If you have installed gatsby-CLI you can then just navigate to the repository and do

```
gatsby develop
```

If not you'll have to install the npm packages and then run the start script:

```
npm install
npm start
```

(`npm start` actually just runs `gatsby develop` in this project so it's just a longer shortcut

## Licence

The template is modified and redistributed under the licence in [LICENCE.md](LICENCE.md). All unchanged parts of the template is licenced under [gatsby-simplefolio-LICENCE.md](gatsby-simplefolio-LICENCE.md).
